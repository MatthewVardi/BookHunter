## BookHunter

Capstone (CSCI499) Project for Computer Science at Hunter College

In order to reduce the burden of preparing for an academic semester, our product will solve Hunter College studentsâ€™ problem of acquiring and disposing books by giving them a platform to locate books that they need. We know if our product works when we see two Hunter College students successfully performing an exchange.
